				<p>Welcome to the official Homepage of the <b>21st Horizons in Molecular Biology!</b></p>
				<p>This year's Horizons is already over, and the organization of next year's conference has already begun. It will take place <b>from 8th to 11th of September 2025</b> - safe the date! We, the Horizons 2024 Organizing Team, would like to thank all of you who  participated in this year's conference. It was a pleasure having you here in GÃ¶ttingen, engaging in vivid scientific discussions with you and enjoying all the fun activities outside of the lecture hall together!</p>
				<p>Traditionally, the first day of the conference is reserved for our <b>Career Fair</b>. This is not only the chance to meet scientists from outside of academia who share insights on how their career path led them to the exciting work they are currently doing, but also to develop soft skills in workshops specifically designed to the needs of PhD students and Postdocs.<br>
				For the <b>Scientific Talks</b>, traditionally scheduled from Tuesday to Thursday, we are pleased to welcome a broad spectrum of internationally renowned scientists working in the fields of Cell Biology, Structural Biology, Bioinformatics, Neurosciences, Genome Maintenance and Expression, and Immunology. Fore more information, please see <a href="program/lectures.html">here</a>.</p>
				<p>If you want to <b>support Horizons</b> with a donation or represent a company that would like to get in touch with a new generation of highly motivated, international students in the field of life sciences, please check out our information on <b>donations and advertisement</b> <a href="about/partners.html">here</a>.</p>
				<p>In case you have any questions, check out the FAQ, or feel free to <a href="contact/index.html">contact us</a>.</p>
